# Task Management Deletion Feature

## Overview
The task management page now includes the ability to delete tasks with proper confirmation dialogs, completing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for task management.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
1. **`dbQueryTask.py`**: Added `delete_task(db, task_id)` function to handle task deletion from the database
2. **`routes/task_routes.py`**: 
   - Added import for the `delete_task` function
   - Added `POST /delete_task/<task_id>` route that handles task deletion requests
   - Returns JSON response indicating success or failure

### Frontend Changes
1. **`templates/task.html`**:
   - Added delete button next to the edit button in the actions column
   - Added delete confirmation modal with proper styling
   - Added JavaScript functions for:
     - `deleteTask(taskId)` - Shows confirmation modal
     - Confirmation and cancellation handlers
     - AJAX call to backend delete route
     - Page reload after successful deletion

2. **`static/style.css`**:
   - Added styling for delete button (red color scheme)
   - Added styling for cancel button and confirmation modal
   - Added proper spacing between action buttons

## User Experience
1. User clicks the "Delete" button next to any task
2. A confirmation modal appears asking "Are you sure you want to delete this task? This action cannot be undone."
3. User can either:
   - Click "Delete" to confirm deletion
   - Click "Cancel" to abort the operation
4. On confirmation, the task is deleted from the database
5. User sees a success message and the page refreshes to show updated task list
6. On error, user sees an error message with details

## Security & Error Handling
- Authentication check: Only logged-in users can delete tasks
- AJAX error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Database transaction safety through try/catch blocks
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions

## Files Modified
- `dbQueryTask.py` - Added delete function
- `routes/task_routes.py` - Added delete route
- `templates/task.html` - Added delete button, modal, and JavaScript
- `static/style.css` - Added styling for delete functionality

## Testing Verified
- Import tests pass for all modified Python files
- Flask application starts successfully
- No syntax errors in HTML/CSS/JavaScript

This completes the task management CRUD functionality, providing users with full control over their task tickets.
